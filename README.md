Data Structures

## Simple implementations of:
  1. stacks
    * Full unit test coverage including errors
    * Implements push & pop
    * No collaborators, some reference to Wikipedia VDM definition
  2. linked list
    * Full unit test coverage including errors
    * Implements insert, pop, size, search, remove, print
    * No collaborators, some reference to Wikipedia VDM definition
  3. parse_parentheses(text)
    * Counts parentheses in text, decides if all opened ones are closed or if anything is broken
    * Returns 1 if more open, -1 if closes unopened ones, 0 if all opens are closed
    * Tests provided
  4. Doubly linked list
    * Inherits from linked list, which gave me the very useful search() method,
      but was otherwise confusing.
    * Doubly linked lists are more useful when you need to use both ends (like a queue, see below)
